Xfce Panel Switch xfpanel-switch is a simple utility that can back up and restore your panel configuration. It includes a couple of different configs you can try out but use its "Save Configuration" option to backup your set up first.

It can also be used to preserve your existing setup while you experiment with some new configurations.
